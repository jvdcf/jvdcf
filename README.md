# 🎓 João Ferreira

Hi! 👋  
I am a Portuguese student at the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto (FEUP) studying for a degree in computer science and computing engineering [(L.EIC)](https://paginas.fe.up.pt/~estudar/cursos/licenciatura-engenharia-informatica/).   
**This is all to improve the world, bit by bit.**
